# Description

The goal of this project was to start using the basics for web development by creating my first webpage. To achieve that, I created my personal webpage that contains some basic information about me as well as relevant professional/academic aspects.
The first page (home) contains basic information, my interests, some pictures, music and videos I like.
The second page (about) contains information about my professional experience, academic background, and projects I've worked on.
The webpage also includes some contact links (mail and LinkedIn).
